Modules
----------
Modules are a fundamental concept that allows you to organize and structure your code. Modules help in keeping code modular, reusable, and maintainable. 


->only typing node will let me access function and variables in the files in that directory.

->common js runs normally but to run ES modules i need to create package.json where i have to declare type is module.

->readFileSync is the function that reads data from a file and uses encoding to print it.It is synchronous.
->Asynchronous same as readFile but takes extra input which is a call back function which returns null and result.

->We can use performance.now() to check diff between async and sync nature 


We can use npm init to form package.json
